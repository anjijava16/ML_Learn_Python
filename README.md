# To learn Machine Learning in Python, you first need to follow basic following steps:

# First learn some basic Python. You need to cover some topics like:
```
Variables
Loops
Conditions
List and String Slicing
Dictionaries
Tuples and Argument Packing, Unpacking
Classes (One of the most Important)

```

# Then learn some basic Libraries of Python you will use in Machine Learning:

```
  Numpy
  Pandas
  Matplotlib
 ```
  
# Now for the actual Machine Learning (not the part for code) you need to learn some basic Mathematics too:
 ```
 Linear Algebra (working with Matrix, Vectors)
  Calculus (mostly differentiation)
  Statistics
  
 ``` 
# Search for some Good Content you will get online:
  ```
  For this part, I will go for 
  Coding Block’s Data Scientist course
  The all those points which I mentioned above you need to learn, you have to search online on different websites (YouTube for most of the part) , but in this course, you are getting all at one place.
This course is taught by a brilliant faculty -> Prateek Narang, an alumni from IIT Delhi. The course offers :

# Python Basics
# Data Science Pipeline
# Data Acquisition & Analysis
# Web Scrapping, Google API, FacebookAPI
# Scrapy, Beautiful Soup
# Data Cleaning & Visualization
# Machine Learning from scratch
# Supervised Learning
# Unsupervised Learning
# Deep Learning for Vision
# Deep Learning for NLP
# Frameworks - 
      Numpy, 
      Pandas, 
      Sci-kit, 
      Keras, 
      Matplotlib, 
      Scrapy, 
      BeautifulSoup etc.
      Bonus - Reinforcement Learning for Video Games

The course provides you all kind of resources you need to learn and it’s easy to understand. You can solve interesting challenges and quizzes in it to be a better Data Scientist.

From this course, I’ve done some projects and made a Snapchat Filter model.


This course also provides content about the hot topics in Data Science like GANs, DCGANs, Reinforcement Learning, Music Generation. I’ve even made a model to generate the MNIST dataset using GANs.


To make your learning a little competitive, the course comes with a Leaderboard to let you know how good you doing compared to others. This adds a little fun with the course as you can compete with your friends.
